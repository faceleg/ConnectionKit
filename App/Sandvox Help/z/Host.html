        <p>A site's host is the location it is <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">published</a> to and the company that provides that space. Depending on your situation, your host might be:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>A Dedicated Company</dt>

            <dd>For most sites, hosting will be provided by a dedicated company that you pay.</dd>

            <dt>Your ISP</dt>

            <dd>Your Internet Service Provider (e.g. AOL or BT) may provide free webspace for you.</dd>

            <dt>An Institution</dt>

            <dd>If you are a member of an academic institution (such as a University), they may provide webspace for you.</dd>

            <dt>Your Computer</dt>

            <dd>In some cases, you may wish to <a href="Publishing_to_your_Computer.html" title="Publishing to your Computer">publish to your own computer</a>. This is only really suitable for Intranet sites, or if you have a static IP address.</dd>

            <p>Note: Sandvox makes use of an open-source FTP/SFTP/WebDAV library that works well with most hosts. However, not all hosts are alike, so it is possible that you may have trouble uploading. This is why we allow publication of a page in the Demo version of Sandvox so you can verify for yourself that Sandvox can upload to your host. If you do have problems, please <a href="Support_Forum.html" title="Support Forum">visit our support forum</a> to let us know about the problem, and then use an <a href="FTP_client.html" title="FTP client">FTP</a> program to upload your site.</p>
        </div>

        <p>To <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publish</a> your site, Sandvox normally requires you to enter your host's settings. They should provide this information when you sign up to their services. If you do not have the information when Sandvox requests it, you will have to contact your Host.</p><a name="Recommended_Hosts" id="Recommended_Hosts"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Recommended Hosts</span></h2>

        <p>Karelia has a few hosts that we <a href="Recommended_Hosts.html" title="Recommended Hosts">recommend</a> for use with Sandvox. Though just about any host can be used, some well-known hosts have some known <a href="Known_Quirks_of_Specific_Hosts.html" title="Known Quirks of Specific Hosts">quirks</a> that need to be worked around.</p><a name="Host_Specific_Features" id="Host_Specific_Features"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Host Specific Features</span></h2>

        <p>Some hosts offer additional specialized functionality to their webhosting services, or provide you with the ability to add custom back-end scripts and features to a website.</p>

        <p>For instance, one might see these kinds of features on a server with a custom configuration:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="Password_protecting_a_site.html" title="Password protecting a site">Password protection</a> of certain pages</li>

            <li>Database of contacts or customers</li>

            <li>File upload and storage for site visitors</li>

            <li>"Cookies" where visitors are tracked from page to page</li>

            <li>Forum/Bulletin Board</li>

            <li>Arbitrary form processing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Due to the wide variety of web servers in use, Sandvox is <b>unable</b> to support such features "out of the box." To use functionality like this, you will have to configure your host's server manually using host-provided tools, and create <a href="Raw_HTML.html" title="Raw HTML">Raw HTML</a> content that integrates with the server. You may possibly have to write your own server-side scripts (using, for example, PHP) and set up a database.</p>
