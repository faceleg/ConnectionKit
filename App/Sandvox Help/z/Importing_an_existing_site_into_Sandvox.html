        <h1 class="firstHeading">Importing an existing site into Sandvox</h1>

        <p>You may have previously created and <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">published</a> a website using an application such as Apple's iWeb or another application. You may even have created a site with Sandvox, but then lost the <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> which held its content.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, Sandvox is <b>not</b> able to import existing sites. You can <b>only</b> use Sandvox to open and edit <a href="Document.html" title="Document">Sandvox documents</a>.</p>

        <p>What you can do though, is use Sandvox to quickly create a new site that has the same basic structure as the original.</p>

        <div class="instructions">
            <p><b>If the site was created using Sandvox:</b></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Create a new Sandvox <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> and give it the same <a href="Design.html" title="Design">design</a> as the original site.</li>

                <li>Add the various <a href="Page.html" title="Page">pages</a> and <a href="Collection.html" title="Collection">collections</a> to the <a href="Site_Outline.html" title="Site Outline">Site Outline</a> to recreate the site's structure.</li>

                <li>Copy and paste the contents of the old site into Sandvox. It is generally a good idea to first paste the text into an application such as TextEdit to strip out the HTML code and then pasting that into Sandvox.</li>

                <li>If you have lost your media originals used to create the site, you could use an <a href="FTP_client.html" title="FTP client">FTP client</a> to download the contents of the site's "_Media" folder and retrieve them from there.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="instructions">
            <p><b>If the site was created using another application:</b></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Create a new Sandvox <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> and pick a <a href="Design.html" title="Design">design</a> that you like or is similar to the existing site.</li>

                <li>Add <a href="Page.html" title="Page">pages</a> and <a href="Collection.html" title="Collection">collections</a> to the <a href="Site_Outline.html" title="Site Outline">Site Outline</a> and arrange them to match the structure of the existing site.</li>

                <li>Copy and paste text from the original site into Sandvox; As much of the original <a href="Text_Editing.html#Formatting" title="Text Editing">formatting</a> as possible will be retained. It is generally a good idea to first paste the text into an application such as TextEdit to strip out the HTML code and then pasting that into Sandvox.</li>
