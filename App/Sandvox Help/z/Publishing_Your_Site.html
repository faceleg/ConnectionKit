        <p>At some point you will want to publish your site. Publishing is simply the process of taking your site from Sandvox and placing it somewhere that is accessible to visitors. Before a site can be published, you must first <a href="Setting_Up_Your_Host.html" title="Setting Up Your Host">set up</a> the <a href="Host.html" title="Host">host</a> Sandvox will be publishing it to.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <p>Note: Sandvox makes use of an open-source FTP/SFTP/WebDAV library that works well with most <a href="Host.html" title="Host">hosts</a>. However, not all <a href="Host.html" title="Host">hosts</a> are alike, so it is possible that you may have trouble publishing. (This is why we allow publication of a <a href="Page.html" title="Page">page</a> in the Demo version of Sandvox so you can verify for yourself that Sandvox can upload to your <a href="Host.html" title="Host">host</a>.) If you do have trouble, please <a href="Support_Forum.html" title="Support Forum">visit our support forum</a> to let us know about the problem, and then use an <a href="FTP_client.html" title="FTP client">FTP</a> program to upload your site.</p>
        </div><a name="Publishing_Changes" id="Publishing_Changes"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Publishing Changes</span></h2>

        <p>Generally when publishing, you only want to upload those files that have changed since the site was last published. Publishing the other files will only waste time. This is the default way in which Sandvox publishes a site.</p>

        <p>When you publish changes, Sandvox may actually publish more pages than you thought would be published. In most cases this is normal. Some changes to a single page affect many other pages. For example, if you change a page to be included or excluded from the <a href="Site_Menu.html" title="Site Menu">Site Menu</a>, every other page on the site will have to be updated to show that change in the site menu! Or if you change a page that appears in an index somewhere on your site, those pages containing that index will need to be published.</p>

        <div class="instructions">
            <p><b>Ways to publish the changes to a site:</b></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Click the "Publish" item in the <a href="Toolbar.html" title="Toolbar">toolbar</a>.</li>

                <li>Choose "Publish Changes" from the <a href="Sandvox_Menu_Guide.html#Site" title="Sandvox Menu Guide">Site menu</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If there are no <a href="Page.html" title="Page">pages</a> that need publishing, Sandvox will inform you and nothing will be uploaded.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Note that as of Sandvox version 1.6, you may find that publishing changes still uploads several "resource" files that have already been uploaded. We will address this inefficiency in a future update to Sandvox.</p><a name="Publishing_Everything" id="Publishing_Everything"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Publishing Everything</span></h2>

        <p>Occasionally you may wish to publish every <a href="Page.html" title="Page">page</a> of a site, regardless of whether Sandvox thinks they need uploading or not.</p>

        <div class="instructions">
            <p><b>To publish all pages:</b></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Open the <a href="Sandvox_Menu_Guide.html#Site" title="Sandvox Menu Guide">Site menu</a>.</li>

                <li>Choose "Publish Entire Site."</li>
            </ol>
        </div><a name="Exporting_a_Site" id="Exporting_a_Site"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Exporting a Site</span></h2>

        <p>Sandvox can also <a href="Exporting_a_Site.html" title="Export">export</a> a site to a folder on your computer.</p><a name="Publishing_Progress" id="Publishing_Progress"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Publishing Progress</span></h2>

        <p>While publishing, Sandvox displays the progress made:</p>

        <div class="bordimg">
            <div class="center">
                <div class="floatnone">
                    <span><img alt="" src="img/e/e9/Publishing_progress.jp2" width="295" height="107" /></span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>At any stage you can click the "Stop" button to end publishing. Note that this can leave you with an only half-functional site online.</p>

        <p>Click the "Show Files" triangle to see more detailed information about which files Sandvox is uploading and how far they have progressed. (Hover your mouse over the icon next to each file or folder in the list to see details about the upload.)</p>

        <p>Once publishing is complete, Sandvox will inform you and offer to let you view the site online.</p><a name="After_Publishing" id="After_Publishing"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">After Publishing</span></h2>

        <p>Once you have published your site, you will probably want to add it to the various search engines (e.g. Google). Please see "<a href="Sandvox_sites_and_search_engines.html" title="Sandvox sites and search engines">Sandvox sites and search engines</a>" for more information.</p>
