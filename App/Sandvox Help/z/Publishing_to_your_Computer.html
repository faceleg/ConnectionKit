        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Previous Step</span></h2>

        <p>This article is part of the "<a href="Setting_Up_Your_Host.html" title="Setting Up Your Host">Setting Up Your Host</a>" procedure, and is for you if you have decided to <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publish</a> a site to your own computer. The previous step of this process is "<b><a href="Choosing_a_Publishing_Location.html" title="Choosing a Publishing Location">Choosing a Publishing Location</a></b>."</p>

        <p><a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">Publishing</a> to your computer is generally not suitable for a home setup. It requires your computer to be turned on all the time and accessible from the Internet.</p>

        <p>For full information on ensuring your computer is correctly set up for local publishing, please see the "<a href="Preparing_for_Publishing_to_Your_Computer.html" title="Preparing for Publishing to Your Computer">Preparing for Publishing to Your Computer</a>" article. If you encounter any issues while attempting to publish to your computer, please refer to the article to ensure everything is set up correctly.</p><a name="Publishing_Settings" id="Publishing_Settings"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Publishing Settings</span></h2>

        <p>You are presented with the <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publishing</a> settings for your computer like this:</p>

        <div class="bordimg">
            <div class="center">
                <div class="floatnone">

                </div>
            </div>
        </div><a name="Publishing_Location" id="Publishing_Location"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Publishing Location</span></h3>

        <p>When <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publishing</a> to your computer, you can either store the site in your Home Folder, or the root of the computer:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>My Home Directory</dt>

            <dd>The site is <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">published</a> to the "Sites" folder in your Home folder. Allows a different site or sites to be <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">published</a> for each user of the computer.</dd>

            <dt>Computer</dt>

            <dd>Makes the site the primary one for the whole computer. It is <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">published</a> to:</dd>
        </dl>
        <pre>
Library → Webserver → Documents
</pre>

        <dl>
            <dd>In order to <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publish</a>, you must have permission to write to this folder. If you do not have the necessary permissions, Sandvox will request an administrator's password to enable them.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p><br />
        If you particularly need to <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publish</a> to a different location on your computer (for example, if you have another web server installed), then it is possible to change the location of the "Computer" option using the <a href="Hidden_Preferences.html#Publishing" title="Hidden Preferences">Hidden Preferences</a>.</p><a name="Hostname" id="Hostname"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Hostname</span></h3>

        <p>The Hostname of your computer is the address at which the site will be reachable once it is <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">published</a>. Into this box, you can enter any valid domain name or IP address. Please see the "<a href="Preparing_for_Publishing_to_Your_Computer.html" title="Preparing for Publishing to Your Computer">Preparing for Publishing to Your Computer</a>" article for information on how to find a suitable IP address to use.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, you may be <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publishing</a> the site to your computer for use on your intranet. If so, please see "<a href="Publishing_a_site_for_use_in_an_intranet.html" title="Publishing a site for use in an intranet">Publishing a site for use in an intranet</a>" for more information.</p><a name="Subfolder" id="Subfolder"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Subfolder</span></h3>

        <p>If you are hosting more than one site in your Home Folder or Computer, you must place them each in a separate <a href="Publishing_multiple_sites_to_a_single_Host.html" title="Subfolder">subfolder</a>. If you are only hosting one site, there is no need to enter a <a href="Publishing_multiple_sites_to_a_single_Host.html" title="Subfolder">subfolder</a>.</p>

        <p>To use a <a href="Publishing_multiple_sites_to_a_single_Host.html" title="Subfolder">subfolder</a>, simply enter it in the box. Note that you cannot use any unsuitable characters such as spaces.</p><a name="Next_Step" id="Next_Step"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Next Step</span></h2>

        <p>To continue onto the next step, click the "Continue" button to move on to the <b><a href="Host_Summary.html" title="Host Summary">Host Summary</a></b>. This will tell you if the settings you have entered are suitable. If not, you can click the "Go Back" button to change them.</p>
