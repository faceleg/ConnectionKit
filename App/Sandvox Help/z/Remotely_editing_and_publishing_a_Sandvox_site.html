        <h1 class="firstHeading">Remotely editing and publishing a Sandvox site</h1>

        <p>To work on a Sandvox site, you open a Sandvox <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> in the Sandvox application and edit it. All the information about the site is kept within this <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> and not on the final <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">published</a> website.</p>

        <p>Thus, to edit and <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publish</a> a Sandvox site, you must have access to both the Sandvox application and the site <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a>. Because of this, editing a site from another computer other than your own is rather tricky. A few options are available:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Portable site document</dt>

            <dd>If you will be in a situation where you have access to another Mac with Sandvox installed, you can simply move the site's <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> around with you and edit and <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publish</a> from that. You could place the <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> on a USB thumb drive or perhaps a shared server somewhere.</dd>

            <dt>Remote desktop</dt>

            <dd>If your Sandvox site can be kept on a Mac which is permanently switched on and has Internet access, you could use a tool like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNC" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNC">VNC</a> to remotely access and control that computer. While logged into it, you can then edit and <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publish</a> the site.</dd>

            <dt>Hosted website service</dt>

            <dd>There are a number of services available where the editing of a website is carried out online using a standard web browser, such as <a href="http://www.blogger.com" class="external text" title="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger.com</a>. You could create the two websites - one with Sandvox, and one with Blogger. The Sandvox site acts as the main part of your site and contains information that does not need to be edited. From there you then link to the Blogger site, which can be updated from anywhere.</dd>
