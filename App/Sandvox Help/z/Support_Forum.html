        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Official Sandvox Support Forum</span></h2>

        <p>Karelia maintains a web-based Support Forum, where users are encouraged to submit problems, questions, and suggestions. In this web-based community, Sandvox users help other Sandvox users in a timely manner.</p>

        <p>To visit the Sandvox Support Forum when you're working in the program, go to the Sandvox menu and select "Visit Support Forum."</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://support.karelia.com/?sandvox" class="external text" title="http://support.karelia.com/?sandvox">Visit the Sandvox Support Forum</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Karelia staff monitor this group to file feature requests appropriately, provide help, and track problems. The Support forum is directly linked to Karelia's bug- and feature-tracking system, so as Karelia staffers find issues to fix or to log for the future, we can easily link requests and feedback made by users to our to-do list.</p><a name="Yahoo.21_Group" id="Yahoo.21_Group"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Yahoo! Group</span></h2>

        <p>Another way to find online support as you explore the capabilities of Sandvox is the Sandvox Users Group, where you can meet and talk with other Sandvox users. (Note that the group is not intended for reporting bugs or other feedback.)</p><a name="Signing_Up_for_the_Yahoo.21_Sandvox_Users_Group" id="Signing_Up_for_the_Yahoo.21_Sandvox_Users_Group"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Signing Up for the Yahoo! Sandvox Users Group</span></h3>

        <p>The group is hosted by Yahoo! Groups. If you have a Yahoo! ID, you can sign up at the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sandvox" class="external text" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sandvox">group's home page</a>.</p>

        <p>Or, you can sign up by entering your e-mail address into the form below and follow the instructions given.</p>

        <form method="get" action="http://groups.yahoo.com/subscribe/sandvox">
            <label for="user">Your e-mail address:</label>&nbsp;<input type="text" name="user" value="" size="20" />&nbsp;<input type="submit" alt="Click here to join sandvox discussion list group" name="Join Group" value="Join Group" />
        </form>

        <p>You can then choose to either join the Sandvox Group using a Yahoo! account or to join the mailing list only. By joining the group, you gain extra privileges, such as the ability to view the group archives. With a mailing list only membership, you do not need to sign up for a Yahoo! account; any normal e-mail address is fine.</p><a name="Protecting_your_Privacy" id="Protecting_your_Privacy"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Protecting your Privacy</span></h3>

        <p>You may want to take a moment to adjust some settings on your Yahoo! account to prevent spamming.</p>

        <p>Click on "My Account" at the top of most Yahoo pages when you are signed in.</p>

        <p>Yahoo maintains your name, address, etc. but feel free to fib if you are concerned about online privacy.</p>

        <p>To prevent marketing to your account, we suggest that you click "Editing your marketing preferences", and from that screen, clear all the checkboxes for special offers. You can also specify how Yahoo may or may not contact you.</p>

        <p>Note that there are three "tabs" on this page: Marketing Preferences, Subscriptions, and Alerts. You may also want to check these settings as well.</p>
