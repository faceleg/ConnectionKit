<p>Apart of being a really cool trend, the worn in denim look is really sought after and can usually only be achieved by wearing the same pair of jeans for years upon jeans. Instead of waitting for that to happen narturally, companies like Abercrombie began to sell destroyed denim at their premium prices. But fashion designer Tiffe Fermaint wasn't having any of it. So, she found a way to get the same look, for much, much, less. Here's Tiffe's DIY recipe for destroyed denim.</p>

<p>
The sky is blue because of the atmosphere - without a thick atmosphere, the sky would look just like the sky of the moon - black. We see color in our sky because, which ever direction in the sky we look, light enters our eyes and excites our retinas. This light is sunlight, but as we know light travels in a straight line, it cannot come directly from the sun. When the light from the sun hits the oxygen and nitrogen (not to mention the water vapor and smog) in our atmosphere it is scattered into our eyes.
</p>
<p>
But why is it blue? In the 1860&#8217;s Lord Rayliegh determined that small particles scatter short wavelength light more than long wavelength light. In fact, the amount of light scattered by any small (by small we mean smaller than the wavelengths we&#8217;re interested in) particle is inversly proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. The wavelength of blue light is roughly half the wavelength of red light, so blue light is scattered almost ten times as strongly as red light.</p>
<p>This effect, first noticed by Tyndall in 1856 can be easily investigated: Take a clear glass and fill it with water. Shine a bright flashlight beam through the glass of clear water - the beam will be virtually invisible within the glass and, if you shine the light on a white screen, the light will be white. Now, we will introduce a very, very small amount of milk into the water. The tiny proteins and fats in the milk will scatter the light just like the oxygen in the atmosphere. Milk looks white in the bottle because the tremendous density of scattering particles scatters virtually all the light of every color - so we will add only a tiny amount - just a few drops and stir. The first thing you&#8217;ll notice is that the beam of light is now much more visible within the glass - the fats and proteins scatter some of this light so you can see it. If you slowly increase the milk concentration, the scattered light will become distinctly blue (when it is weak, it is already blue, but our eyes get better at seeing colors when things are more intense). Now, as the blue light is scattered the most and the red light is scattered the least, then the light coming out of the glass is a red/orange color - you can see this clearly on the screen behind the glass.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been thinking as you&#8217;ve been looking at the screen behind your milky water, you might have realised that we have answered another question that comes up almost as often as the color fo the sky - The color of sunsets - Why are they red? When the sun is near the horizon, it has passed through a large distance of atmosphere. As it goes, the blue light scatters much more than the red light, so the light that makes it to you is much redder than basic sunlight.</p>

<p>This is my boss, Jonathan Hart, a self-made millionaire, he's quite a guy. This is Mrs H., she's gorgeous, she's one lady who knows how to take care of herself. By the way, my name is Max. I take care of both of them, which ain't easy, 'cause when they met it was MURDER!</p>

<p>80 days around the world, we'll find a pot of gold just sitting where the rainbow's ending. Time - we'll fight against the time, and we'll fly on the white wings of the wind. 80 days around the world, no we won't say a word before the ship is really back. Round, round, all around the world. Round, all around the world. Round, all around the world. Round, all around the world.</p>
<p>Barnaby The Bear's my name, never call me Jack or James, I will sing my way to fame, Barnaby the Bear's my name. Birds taught me to sing, when they took me to their king, first I had to fly, in the sky so high so high, so high so high so high, so - if you want to sing this way, think of what you'd like to say, add a tune and you will see, just how easy it can be. Treacle pudding, fish and chips, fizzy drinks and liquorice, flowers, rivers, sand and sea, snowflakes and the stars are free. La la la la la, la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la la la la la, so - Barnaby The Bear's my name, never call me Jack or James, I will sing my way to fame, Barnaby the Bear's my name.</p>

<p>Mutley, you snickering, floppy eared hound. When courage is needed, you're never around. Those medals you wear on your moth-eaten chest should be there for bungling at which you are best. So, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon. Howwww! Nab him, jab him, tab him, grab him, stop that pigeon now.</p>
